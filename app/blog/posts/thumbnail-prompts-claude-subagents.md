# Thumbnail Prompts for "Claude Sub-Agents" Article

## Primary Prompt: Orchestrator + Specialists Architecture

```
A modern, technical illustration of an AI agent orchestration system in dark mode. Central orchestrator node in electric blue (#3b82f6) connected to 5 specialized agent nodes in different colors: code-reviewer (green #22c55e), security-auditor (red #ef4444), doc-writer (amber #f59e0b), performance-engineer (purple #a855f7), golang-expert (teal #14b8a6). Clean, geometric design with glowing connections between nodes. Dark slate background (#0f172a). Subtle grid pattern. Isometric perspective. Professional, technical aesthetic. 16:9 aspect ratio, 1200x630px. High contrast, crisp edges. --style technical diagram --v 6
```

**Use case**: Best for representing the core concept of specialized agents working together under orchestration.

## Alternative 1: Pipeline/Flow Concept

```
Abstract visualization of a code review pipeline in dark theme. Left side: messy, unstructured code (chaotic lines). Center: three distinct processing layers with glowing filters - code quality layer (blue #3b82f6), security layer (red #ef4444), performance layer (green #22c55e). Right side: clean, structured output. Data flows left to right through glowing pathways. Dark background (#0f172a with #1e293b gradient). Geometric, minimalist style. 16:9 format, 1200x630px. --style architectural --clean --v 6
```

**Use case**: Emphasizes the transformation aspect and systematic processing.

## Alternative 2: Team/Specialization Metaphor

```
Stylized representation of AI specialists in a collaborative workspace. Dark futuristic office environment (#0f172a background). 5 distinct workstations, each glowing with different specialty colors: code review station (blue), security station (red), documentation station (amber), performance station (purple), language expert station (teal). Each station has unique iconography - magnifying glass, shield, document, lightning bolt, code brackets. Clean isometric view. Professional tech company aesthetic. 16:9, 1200x630px. --style corporate tech --minimal --v 6
```

**Use case**: More approachable, humanizes the concept of specialized agents.

## Alternative 3: Context Isolation Containers

```
Technical diagram showing isolated execution contexts. Dark background (#0f172a). Main container labeled "Primary Context" (large, 60% visible, blue outline #3b82f6) with sub-containers floating around it: smaller isolated boxes labeled with agent names (code-reviewer, security-auditor, etc.) in their respective colors. Visual arrows showing "results only" flowing back to main container. Memory/token indicators showing savings (90% reduction). Clean, architectural blueprint style. High contrast. 16:9, 1200x630px. --style technical infographic --v 6
```

**Use case**: Best for highlighting the context preservation benefit - the "hidden advantage."

## Color Palette Reference

Based on the article's design system:

- **Background**: `#0f172a` (dark slate)
- **Secondary bg**: `#1e293b` (slate)
- **Primary (orchestrator)**: `#3b82f6` (blue)
- **Success/code-reviewer**: `#22c55e` (green)
- **Danger/security**: `#ef4444` (red)
- **Warning/docs**: `#f59e0b` (amber)
- **Info/performance**: `#a855f7` (purple)
- **Accent/golang**: `#14b8a6` (teal)

## Iteration Tips

1. **If too busy**: Reduce to 3 agents instead of 5
2. **If too abstract**: Add subtle code snippets in background
3. **If colors clash**: Use monochrome with one accent color
4. **If not technical enough**: Add terminal-style UI elements
5. **If too technical**: Soften with gradients and blur effects

## Platform-Specific Tweaks

### For Midjourney:
- Add `--ar 16:9` for aspect ratio
- Use `--style raw` for more literal interpretation
- Add `--s 50` for moderate stylization

### For DALL-E 3:
- Be more descriptive about spatial relationships
- Specify "no text" or include exact text placement
- Mention "photorealistic" or "illustrated" explicitly

### For Stable Diffusion:
- Add negative prompts: "blurry, low quality, text, watermark"
- Include "trending on artstation" for quality boost
- Specify render engine: "octane render, unreal engine"

## Recommended Approach

**Start with**: Primary Prompt (Orchestrator + Specialists)
**Reason**: Best represents the article's core concept visually

**If that doesn't work**: Try Alternative 3 (Context Isolation)
**Reason**: Highlights the unique value proposition (context preservation)

**For social media**: Alternative 2 (Team Metaphor)
**Reason**: More approachable and shareable

## Quick Validation Checklist

- [ ] Dark theme matches blog design
- [ ] Colors align with brand palette
- [ ] Readable at thumbnail size (400px width)
- [ ] Visually distinct from generic AI imagery
- [ ] Conveys "orchestration" or "specialization"
- [ ] Professional, not playful
- [ ] Works without text overlay
